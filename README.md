XFGlossSample is a Xamarin.Forms-based app that demonstrates the [XFGloss](https://github.com/tbaggett/xfgloss) project. It demonstrates all XFGloss properties being applied in both Xaml and C# code. I've separated it into its own repo and added NuGet references for the XFGloss package so it can serve as a reference for XFGloss users.
